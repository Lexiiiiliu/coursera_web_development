			<p id="label1"> Ruby </p> 
			<p class="content"> Ruby is a peppy rabbit villager from the Animal Crossing series. Her name refers to the gem ruby, since her eyes are a deep red, which is an effect of albinism — a condition which, in the real world, is more common in rabbits than any other animal due to selective breeding. Her Japanese name, Luna, as well as her house being space themed, is likely a reference to the moon rabbit—a mythological creature in many Asian folklores, which is also often depicted as being white. Her birthday is on Christmas Day. </p>

			<p id="label2"> Apollo </p> 
			<p class="content"> Apollo is a cranky eagle villager in the Animal Crossing series. He also appears in Dōbutsu no Mori as a minor character. Apollo is a bald eagle, specifically, the national bird of the United States of America, hence his July 4 birthday (Independence Day in the United States). He has the music hobby.</p>
